# Installing Vscode

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that helps programmers write, test, and debug their code more easily by combining useful tools in one place. Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is a popular IDE developed by Microsoft that supports many programming languages, including Python. When using Python, VS Code becomes a powerful assistant for beginners because it highlights your code to make it easier to read, offers helpful suggestions as you type, points out errors before you even run your program, and lets you run your Python scripts directly from the editor. It also includes features like a built-in terminal and the ability to install extensions that can make Python development even smoother. For someone learning Python for the first time, VS Code is a great environment because it not only helps you write code but also guides you in understanding and fixing your mistakes.

To install VS Code, you can execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
```

Close and reopen the terminal. Now you can start using VS Code. To open VS Code in the current folder from the terminal, use the following command:

```bash
code .
```
