# Versioning

In the fast-paced world of machine learning, experiments are constantly evolving. Data changes, code is refined, and models are tweaked. Without a robust system to keep track of these modifications, it's incredibly easy to lose sight of what worked, what didn't, and why. Imagine trying to reproduce a groundbreaking result from weeks ago, only to find you've forgotten the exact version of the dataset, the specific hyperparameter settings, or even the subtle changes in your preprocessing script. This "reproducibility crisis" in ML highlights the critical need for tools that can bring order to this complex chaos. This is where DVC comes in.

## DVC

DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source tool that brings version control capabilities to machine learning projects. Think of it like Git, but instead of just tracking code, DVC tracks large files, datasets, and machine learning models. Its primary purpose is to help data scientists and ML engineers manage their machine learning workflows in a reproducible and collaborative way.

In machine learning, DVC is used to:

* **Version control data and models:** Just as Git tracks changes in code, DVC tracks changes in datasets and trained models. This allows users to easily revert to previous versions of data or models, understand what changes were made, and ensure reproducibility of experiments.
* **Reproduce experiments:** DVC allows you to define the steps of your machine learning pipeline (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation) as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). By tracking dependencies between data, code, and models, DVC can automatically rebuild previous results, ensuring that anyone can reproduce an experiment exactly.
* **Manage large files:** Machine learning often involves large datasets and model files that are not suitable for traditional code versioning systems like Git. DVC stores metadata about these large files in Git, while the actual data is stored externally (e.g., on cloud storage like S3, Google Cloud Storage, or locally), making it efficient to manage them.
* **Facilitate collaboration:** By providing a clear system for tracking data and model versions, DVC makes it easier for teams to collaborate on machine learning projects, ensuring everyone is working with the correct data and models.
